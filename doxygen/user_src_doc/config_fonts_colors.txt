You can change many of the colors and fonts used in FLDIGI to suit your
operating style.  Those shown at the left are the defaults.

You can use the color dialog to set the colors, or if you understand the RGB
color system you may directly edit the prefs file associated with the
transceiver you are using.  The prefs file is located in the FLRIG folder.

On linux and OS X this folder is
\verbatim
$HOME/.FLDIGI
\endverbatim

On Vista / Win7,
\verbatim
C:\Users\<usr>\FLRIG.files
\endverbatim

The prefs file for the TT-550 Pegasus would be TT-550.prefs.
