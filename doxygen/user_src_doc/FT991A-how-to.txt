CAT control involves both software and settings on the radio itself. The 
default radio settings on the FT-991A are not likely to work “out of the box”.

Some initial things to verify are in place:

<ul>
<li>Download and install the USB driver for the radio. NOTE: be sure the 
USB cable is UNPLUGGED from the computer when you install the driver 
regardless of the OS your are using.
<ul>
<li>If you’re using Windows get the driver from 
<A HREF="https://www.yaesu.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&ProdCatID=102&encProdID=490C4A71118AD0F4E825E89D821B73BB&DivisionID=65&isArchived=0">Yaesu</A>.
</li>
<li>If using Linux or MacOS then get the drivers direct from 
<A HREF="https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers">Silicon Labs</A>.
Some versions of Linux have a driver built in.</li>
<li>For MacOS High Sierra and later be sure to go to Security & Privacy in 
the System Configuration settings and in the General tab allow the driver 
to be accessed. Without doing that it will be unusable.</li>
</ul>
<li>Download the latest version of <A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/files/fldigi/">Fldigi</A>. Flrig is written as a companion 
to fldigi and adds much greater rig control than is possible with just 
fldigi. It is especially good with the FT991A. I basically only touch the 
radio to turn it on or off when running digital modes, and even that can be 
automated.</li>
</ul>

You should have already installed the driver for the built-in sound card in the FT-991A.

Connect the rig to the computer with a USB A-Male to B-Male cable and turn on the radio.

\subsection initial_setup Initial Setup
With the radio on and the USB cable connected and no other communications 
program running, Start flrig.  It will come up with just a basic display. 
<center>
\image latex flrig-none.png "Initial Flrig Dialog" width=4.0in
\image html flrig-none.png "Initial Flrig Dialog"
</center>

Open the menu <em>Config/Setup/Transceiver</em>.

<center>
\image latex xcvr.png "Select FT991A" width=6.0in
\image html  xcvr.png "Select FT991A"
</center>

Choose the FT991A from the Rig dropdown list. That will select the default 
settings which will work on . Note: The RTS +12v and DTR +12v boxes do not 
normally need to be checked.

\subsection ssSerialPort Select the Serial Port to use:
<ul>
<li>Mac / Linux - Select the SilconLabs driver from the dropdown list. If it 
isn't in the list then click the SerPort button to repopulate the list. It if 
still isn't in the list then the driver is not loading for some reason like the 
radio is not on or connected or the driver has not been installed properly so 
that needs to be rectified before going on. If you're using MacOS High Sierra 
or a later version of MacOS you may need to authorize the driver install in 
Security & Privacy setup in System Preferences after runing the install program. 
There will be a message on the General page if it has been blocked.<li>
<li>Windows  - Open the device manager and determine to which com port the 
serial driver from Silcon Labs is assigned and choose that from the drop down list.  
Verify that the Baud rate in flrig matches the baud rate selected in the rig. It's 
better to choose a fixed baud rate than Auto.  Now, click the Init button. It should 
go from red to black lettering. If it does not go to black lettering then verify all 
of the above again, especially baud rate and echo.</li>
<li>Flrig now should have control of the rig so changing frequency in flrig will 
changed the frequency on the rig and visa versa. The buttons and sliders should 
do as they are labeled.</li>
</ul>

\subsection ssRestore Restore tab:
<center>
\image latex restore.png width=6.0in
\image html  restore.png
</center>

and choose whether you want flrig to save and restore all the radio’s parameters 
on startup and exit or whether you want it to open with the same settings as the 
rig is currently using.  If Use xcvr data is checked flrig will start up with the 
same settings as the rig currently is using.

\subsection ssPoll Poll tab
<center>
\image latex polling.png width=6.0in
\image html  polling.png
</center>
and click the Set All buttons for the initial polling options. You can play with 
these values later if you wish. The larger the number the slower the response time 
to button pushes etc, but also the less load on the system so there is a balance. 
A very fast machine can use all ones, but there is normally no need to add the 
additional load to your system for that.

I would recommend before you move on that you go to the Config/UI menu and 
select Tooltips. They are a great help to the new user to figure out what 
each control does as not all are labeled.  You can choose 4 different UI’s 
from the narrow one with small sliders (I use this one – see above screen 
shot of flrig), to a narrow one with large sliders, to a wide version or 
a touch version.  Now close flrig and restart it to be sure all is well . 
Everything should be working and you should be able to change frequency 
on the radio and flrig should follow.

\section fldigi_flrig_ft991a flrig/FT991A/fldigi

Start fldigi and fill in the initial setup pages presented. You can ignore 
the last page for now. All these pages can be accessed via the configuration 
menu later to be changed as you wish.  Since you've chosen to use flrig then 
go to the fldigi menu “Configuration/Rig control/flrig” and check the top 
box to tell fldigi to use flrig for rig control with fldigi as client.   
Leave the other controls at their default setting.
<center>
\image latex flrig-fldigi.png width=6.0in
\image html  flirig-fldigi.png
</center>
Once that is done fldigi should communicate with flrig and changes such as 
frequency or bandwidth in flrig or fldigi should be reflected in the other. 
If the lower box is checked then flrig will send fldigi audio to the radio 
when the PTT button is clicked otherwise PTT will just key the rig with no 
power out. Click Save at the bottom of the page.

All that is left is to customize fldigi for how you want to operate. Many 
things can be changed such as the UI scheme, colors, Macros, and many more. 
Read the help manual to learn about all the options and features that are 
available.

\subsection ssfinal_setup Final Setup

With fldigi running verify you have a blue waterfall running. If you don't 
see that then there is a problem with the audio input to fldigi. Verify the 
Soundcard setup.

Note:
<ul>
<li> For MacOS Mojave and later you must enable the microphone for fldigi 
in Security & Privacy in the System Preferences settings.</li>
<li> For Windows 10 be sure to grant permission for fldigi to access the Microphone.</li>
</ul>

Now we will verify the power out of the radio. Set the radio power control 
on the rig to max, 100% and leave it there.

Set Power Meter scale: Right click on the lower portion of the S-meter scale 
and choose the power scale desired.  The max digital power out used for a QSO 
should cause no ALC action on the radio. The FT991A will put out quite a bit 
of power without ALC action, but you don't want to interfere with other close 
signals on the band either so ideally the power should be between 25-40 watts.
